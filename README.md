<ul><b>DESCRIPTION</b></ul>

 My Project gives a detailed description about the calculator. The CALCULATOR is a versatile device that performs arithmetic calculations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus, Square, Cube, Square Root, Cube Root, Powers, Logarithms, Sine, Cosine, Tangents etc. Basically, there are two types of calculator according to my project. 
 They are :- </br><b>1.Standard Calculator</b><br>     <b>2.Scientific Calculator  </b></br></br>
 
 
<ul><b>OBJECTIVE</b></ul>


 • Designing The Menu based computerization calculator system.


 • Use The Library Function.


• Create C++ Classes And Functions.


• Performing Different Types of Calculation Including Normal And Scientific Calculation.


 • The Screen Display Mode.</br></br>



<b>SCOPE:</b></br>


•	This calculator project has on-line implementation</br>
•	Menu based screen design.</br>
•	Help menu for on- line help</br>
•	Save option for previous calculation.</br></br>


<b>LIMITATION</b></br>


•	This project is menu based design.</br>
•	System may hang sometime when wrong data is entered. </br>
•	This project is free from virus.</br></br>




<b>PROBLEM:</b></br>
                      When we do some arithmetic calculations we also need a calculator. When there is no computer based calculation at that time we must need a separate calculator; which will sometime postponed our work due to this factor.
•	In hand hold calculator there is not enough help for calculations without a manual book
•	At any time manual books don’t provide enough help or an ordinary user cannot understand it.
•	We cannot save or view the pervious.
